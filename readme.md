## Learning Objectives

After completing this lab, students will be able to:

1. Respond to user input
2. Attach event listeners to DOM elements
3. Update the DOM following user events

## Task

Handout code is provided in [index.html](index.html). Extend this code to complete the following features:

1. Implement basic mathematical operations:
    * Addition (+)
    * Subtraction (-)
    * Multiplication (*)
    * Division (/)
2. "C" (Clear) button must reset the calculator's state and display
3. Calculator must correctly handle decimal numbers
4. The application must be fully accessible using only the keyboard. Users should be able to:
    * Use the Tab key to move focus between buttons
    * Use the Spacebar or Enter key to activate a focused button

> [!TIP]
> Your JavaScript code should be placed within the `<script>` element located just before the closing `</body>` tag in `index.html`. This ensures the HTML elements are loaded before your script tries to interact with them.
